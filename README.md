# Fraudulent-Face-Image-Detection


### Introduction:
This project involved the development of an advanced image recognition system designed to detect fraudulent facial images. Utilizing cutting-edge technologies, the system showcases real-time results through a customized Tkinter UI.


* Training Data: The proposed system was trained using a dataset of 2041 images, comprising 960 fake images and 1081 real images. This diverse dataset ensured comprehensive training of the models.<br>
* Testing Data: The system was tested on 409 images, including both real and fake images. The results showcased the predictive capabilities of the models.<br>
* SVC Model Accuracy: 65% <br>
* CNN Model Accuracy: 94% <br>

* End-to-End Development: Led the entire project lifecycle from concept to deployment, ensuring a seamless integration of all components. <br>
* Customized Tkinter UI: Developed a user-friendly interface with Tkinter to display real-time results, enhancing the user experience and interaction with the system. <br>
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Designed and implemented a CNN architecture specifically tailored for image analysis. The CNN effectively extracts features from the images, contributing significantly to the system's accuracy. <br>
* Support Vector Classifier (SVC): Integrated SVC to classify the extracted features, further refining the accuracy of fraudulent image detection. <br>
* Deep Learning Techniques: Leveraged deep learning techniques to enhance the performance and reliability of the image recognition system. <br>
